# syn-round
simple application to round/blur the synapse x ui
<br />along with a nice looking theme

---

### how to use it:
Copy *round.exe* and *round_options.json* into your Synapse launcher folder.
**I also recommend you take my theme files and put them in your *bin* folder.**

### configuring options (*round_options.json*):
here is an example of what round_options.json will looks like:
```json
{
  "SynX File": "SYNAPSE FILE NAME GOES HERE",
  "Rounding": {
	  "Enabled": true,
	  "Small": false
  },
  "Blur": false
}
```

where it says SYNAPSE FILE NAME GOES HERE
you need to find the synapse exe from ***INSIDE YOUR *bin* FOLDER!***

### NOTE THAT THERE WILL BE 2 SYNAPSE EXE FILES, SIMPLY PICK THE ONE WITH THE LARGEST FILE SIZE, FOR ME IT WAS THE FIRST ONE!

## running the program
once you have followed all the steps and chosen your settings, just run the *round.exe* program
it should automatically start synapse for you.
